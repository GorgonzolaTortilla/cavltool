>Place these files in a folder together. The remaining files will be generated automatically.

The resulting folder is ready for use and contains all the necessary files to get the user started. 

To familiarize the user with AVL Tool's setup and features, *AVL Tool Starter Guide.pdf* provides introductory material and tutorials. 

These tutorials use the *vanilla.avl* plane provided with AVL's *runs/* directory.

To analyze your own *.avl* files, place the *.avl* file and necessary airfoil/body *.dat* files into the folder with AVL Tool and *avl.exe*
